API I used today:

1. kanya.rest API
2. Joke API
3. OpenWeather API and more 

Website I used by creating my own key :

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=imadol&appid=1db849ab2828c5547e48ecfe417c1e99&mode=html

Today i used postman for the first time.
I put different parameters in the api link and it gave me outputs.

I was curious about how people use postman and now I am starting to learn postman and it feels really satisfying to use postman by own.


Love you guyssss......!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
